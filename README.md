A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.

In a stack, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint. The behavior of a stack is described as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO). When an element is “pushed” onto the stack, it becomes the first item that will be “popped” out of the stack. In order to reach the oldest entered item, you must pop all the previous items.

The following are the basic operations served by stacks.

push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
isEmpty: Checks whether the stack is empty.
isFull: Checks whether the stack is full.
top: Displays the topmost element of the stack.

A Queue is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements. The queue operates on first in first out (FIFO) algorithm

Operations On A Queue
Enqueue- adding an element in the queue if there is space in the queue.
Dequeue- Removing elements from a queue if there are any elements in the queue
Front- get the first item from the queue.
Rear- get the last item from the queue.
isEmpty/isFull- checks if the queue is empty or full
